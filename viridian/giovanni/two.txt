Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
I thought not.
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you.
It's a Sith legend.
Darth Plagueis was a dark lord of the Sith so wise and so powerful he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life...
he had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even prevent the ones he cared about from dying.
