% ps aux > temp1.txt
% awk '{ print $1 }' temp1.txt > temp2.txt
% sort temp2.txt > temp3.txt
% uniq temp3.txt > temp4.txt
% wc –l < temp4.txt > temp5.txt
% cat temp5.txt

uniq uniquely sorts results of running awk

% ps aux | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort | uniq | wc –l

understand all that! CHECK

multiple commands can be sequenced. date; who; pwd

(date; who; pwd) > logfile
is different from

ls -l *.txt will list all .txt files

!! repeats last command

!n repeats command number n

!-n repeats command typed n commands ago

env

this will give you a lot of critical info about your machine: short for
environmental variables

echo $PATH
this will tell you where you are

~/.bash_profile sources231
