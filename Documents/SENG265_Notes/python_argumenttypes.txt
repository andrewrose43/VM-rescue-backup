There are THREE types of command line argument: positional arguments, named arguments, and flags.

A POSITIONAL argument is a bare value, and its position in a list of arguments identifies it.

A NAMED argument is a (key, value) pair, where the key identifies the value.

A FLAG is a standalone key, whose presence or absence provides information to the application.

In the following command...

rename file1.txt file2.txt

then the position of the arguments identifies the value.
-The value in position 1 ("file1.txt") is the current name and the value in position 2 ("file2.txt") is the new name

Keys are identified by - when they are single letters and -- when they are words.
