Jupyter notebook is a method to contain code and documentation in one.
Lets you put formulas and figures, etc alongside the actual code.

You put segments of code within a text document... this is like a Google Doc. Great for collaboration.

Self in python is like this in java
there is usually a special method called __init__ in any class, which instantiates the thing

class Student:
	def __init__(self, n, a):
		self.full_name = n
		self.age = a
	def get_age(self):
		return self.age
	def set_age(self,num)
		self.age = num
		print(self.age)

b = Student("Bob", 21)
print(b.age)
b.set_age(23)
print("old age: {}, oops new age: {}", b.age, b.set_age(23))
# the above code might be a little wrong

class Sample:
	x = 23 # class attribute
	def increment(self):
		self.__class__.x += 1
		self.y = 2 # data attribute

a = Sample()
a.increment() # you declare it with self but do not give it itself as a parameter
print(a.__class__.x)
print(a.y)


class counter:
	overall_total = 0
	def __init__(self):
		self.my_total = 0

	def increment(self):
		counter.overall_total = counter.overall_total + 1
		self.my_total = self.my_total + 1
# finish this... go thru the jupyter document
