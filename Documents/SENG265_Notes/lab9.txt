[\d]{5}
matches a sequence of 5 DIGITS

In order to match... an email address:
buncha chars @ something.com

'[\w]+@[\w]+\.[\w]{2,}'

the {2,} makes sure the email address is @ somewhere with 2 letters or more


\w matches 'word' characters: numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and underscores.

Matching V numbers:

[a-z][0-9]+ matches k9, A7, f001
([a-z][0-9])+ matches r2d2

[1-49] matches 1-4 and 9. the set of things that match is 1,2,3,4,9


ptrn = r'[\w]+@[\w]+\.[\w]{2,}'

that r'pattern' r there is how you create a pattern in python!

str = "contains an email addr andrew.rose43@gmail.com"
str2 = "some other thing"
match2 = re.search(ptrn,str2,re.IGNORECASE) # welcome to option flags
if (match2):
	print("Match Found")
else:
	print("No Match")
	
groups = re.findall(ptrn, str) # this returns a list containing all the substrings that matched the regex

substr = "XXXX@XXXX.XXX"
newstr = re.sub(ptrn, substr, str)
# the above will replace all instances of the 'ptrn' regex with instances of substr
