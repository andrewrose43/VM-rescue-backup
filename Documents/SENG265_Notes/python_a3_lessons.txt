li = sorted(li, key = lambda x: x[1], -x[0])
	#will sort by the second item in the subli and then by the first item in the subli in reverse order (minus sign)

Setting nargs to '?' will do this...
One argument will be consumed from the command line if possible, and produced as a single item. If no command-line argument is present, the value from default will be produced. Note that for optional arguments, there is an additional case - the option string is present but not followed by a command line argument. In this case the value from const will be produced. This is useful for allowing optional input and output files.

'*' is the nargs operator you have been looking for in asst 3's ferry thing. It gathers all present command-line args into a list. '+' is the same, but it also generates an error message if there was not at least one command-line argument.

Once you have used the * operator as above to open multiple files, args.filename will be a list that can be iterated through
