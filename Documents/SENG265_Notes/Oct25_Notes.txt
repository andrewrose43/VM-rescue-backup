Be sure to test Asst 2 using the .zip test files on Connex!

Your program needs to run its sorting algorithm on a linked list! (Of words!)

getline() uses realloc in its implementation

When comparing strings, just change them all to lowercase. There must be a function for that.

Look up getline()! Figure out what the deal is.


DEBUGGING

A bug is NOT something causing the compiler to make an error message or  any kind of error which causes the linker to report a problem. It refers to anything that makes the program behave in a way other than what is expected.

error: the incorredt code fragment which causes the fault
fault: the state of the program which leads to the failure
failure: something visible to the user of the program

Take the example of a loop that finds the lowest of a player's scores.
Forgetting to initialize the variable that stores the lowest score would be an error.
@ runtime, the search then fails to find the correct lowest score. This is a fault.

memory leak: forgetting to free memory. You eventually run out of memory.

these are some, not all, of bug categories
A - algorithm was poorly conceived
	-off-by-one errors
	-logic errors (simply wrong algorithms)
	-validation - failure to check validity of variables. ex. cases of input that immediately break loops
	-performance: an inappropriate algorithm, or a coding error which leads to unacceptable performance
D - read or wrote wrong Data
	-index: an array index is wrong
	-limit: incorrect handling for the first of last elements in a sequence
	-number: issues related to how numbers are represented in the computer
	-memory: attempting to access an inaccessible location, deallocating a block twice, failing to deallocate a block, continuing to use a pointer to a block after the block has been freed
F - Forgotten
	-missing: forgetting to provide code for some case
	-location: code appears in the wrong place or is out of order
B - Blunder
	-incorrectly written expression
	-variable: wrote the wrong variable name
	-language: a mistake encouraged by the language syntax
