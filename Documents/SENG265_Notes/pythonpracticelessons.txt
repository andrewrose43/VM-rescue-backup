def main(): this prevents the main's contents from being executed if the script is imported as a module

Interesting: separating parts of print statements with commas automatically inserts spaces between them, but doing so with pluses does not add spaces. Both work!

yes, an int of any nonzero value evaluates to true cleanly

You can just print a list like so:
print new_list

for val in i: #notice that you don't put parens around your for loops!

Strings are lists!
for example...

string = "example"
for c in string:
	print "one letter: " + c

will print:

one letter: e
one letter: x
one letter: a
...


True and False need to be capitalized like so!
