void main(){
	char s[] = "C++";
	printf("%s \n", s);
	s++;
	printf("%s \n", s);
}

this code is faulty and will result in a compile error!

correct version"

void main(){
        char s[] = "C++";
	char *p = s;
        printf("%s \n", s);
        p++;
        printf("%s \n", p);
}

the moral of the story is that you cannot increment a string,
but you can increment a pointer to a string
