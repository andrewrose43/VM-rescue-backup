less process than python
got to get memorized all that python syntax that you looked up on the assignments
need to know gdb but not valgrind
be sure to review python dictionaries, maps, list comprehensions

from panel discussion:
communication in slack is a bit difficult but crucial
when working on software, you must understand the spec!! (duh)
if you're on time, you're late
Don't only do what you are told
Try to be the one that everyone goes to because you know a lot & are available


from math import sin, cos, tan, pi

def map_function(x, functions):
"""map an iterable of functions on the object x"""

	res = []
	for func in functions:
		res.append(func(x))
		more I couldn't copy fast enough...


lambda functions are useful for simple functions called only once


def map_functions(x, functions):
	return (res = [func(x) for func in functions])
