INTEGERS ARE IMMUTABLE.

a = [1,2,3]
b=a #b now points to the same thing that a does!
a.append(4) #this changes the list pointed to by both a and b!!

def get_final_answer(filename):
	"""Documentation String"""
	line1
	line2
	return total_counter

It's possible to redefine system functions for new parameters...

def append(l,x):
	l.append(x) #this code/function/whatever is LOCAL

#!/opt/bin/python3
#must be in your code?
#that's where python is located on your computer

every module included could have its own main function

that if __name__ == "__main__":
main()
thing
is needed to make the main run.

FOR LOOPS
for <item> in <collection>:
	<statements>

line.strip() will take a line from stdin
line.split() will return a list of words in the line that was just dumped in line by line.split()

li = [3,6,2,7]
[elem*2 for elem in li] # you need to assign this to equal something in reality
[6,12,4,14]

[expression for name in list]

li = [('a',1), ('b', 2), ('c', 7)]
[n*3 for (x.n in li]
[3,6,21]

li = [3,6,2,7,1,9]
[elem*2 for elem in li if elem > 4]
[12, 14, 18]
#only produces any output at all if elem>4. If not, output contains no product of elem

We now are able to do Assignment 3!
